# LoginTestBotc
This repository showcases a login page test case using Robot Framework, Selenium, and Python, tailored for SVCE students. It demonstrates automated testing practices with detailed setup, execution, and result analysis. Ideal for learning web testing fundamentals, this project is a hands-on guide to mastering test automation basics.

# Setup
#### Create a Virtual Environment
1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Create a virtual environment using the following command:
```python -m venv venv```
4. Activate the virtual environment:
   - On Windows: ```venv\Scripts\activate```
   - On macOS/Linux: ```source venv/bin/activate```
#### Install Dependencies
1. Ensure you have Python installed (version 3.6 or higher).
2. Install the required packages using pip:
```pip install -r requirements.txt```
#### Run the Test Cases
From the project directory, execute the following command to run all test cases in the TestCases directory:
```robot -P . .\TestCases```
> Explanation of -P: This sets the PYTHONPATH variable. Since the tests are run from the project directory (.\LoginTestBotc), -P . ensures that the Python path is correctly configured to include the project directory.



<span style="color: #940D7D;">This project focuses on building the fundamentals of automated testing using Robot Framework, Selenium, and Python. 
Test cases include comments for clarity where explanations are needed and are designed to be as diverse as possible. 
Though basic, it offers a solid foundation and room for enhancements.
